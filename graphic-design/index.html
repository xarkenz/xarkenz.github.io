                    <p><b>Project:</b> Low Poly Portrait</p>
                    <p><b>Objective:</b> Using only polygons, recreate an image of any subject (person, animal, mask, etc.) in low-poly style.</p>
                    <p><b>Software:</b> Adobe Illustrator</p>
                    <p>
                        I chose to recreate an image of a red fox because I had done a similar project a few years back and wanted to show how much I had learned since that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process I used to create this effect was fairly straightforward.
                        First, I used the pen tool to plot triangles, trying to maintain borders between colors while minimizing repetition.
                        I then used the Live Paint Bucket tool along with the color picker tool to grab a defining color from the image for each polygon, then fill.
                        To finish, I created a background to loosely match the snowy background of the original image.

                    <p><b>Objective:</b> Create a colorful travel poster showcasing a specific destination in our solar system (like a planet, comet, ocean, crater, or asteroid).</p>
                    <p><b>Software:</b> Adobe Illustrator / InDesign</p>
                    <p>
                        The inspiration we were given included <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galleries/visions-of-the-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA's "Visions of the Future"</a>,
                        which featured a sort of New Deal aesthetic. I thought that would be interesting to replicate, so I went with that idea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What caught my attention about Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter (and the largest moon in the solar system!), is that its surface is a thick layer of ice,
                        but there are vast oceans that lie underneath. So, my idea for a futuristic civilization on Ganymede was one which built upside-down cities <i>under</i> the ice,
                        which would put them underwater.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The artwork is styled with a lot of gradients and Gaussian blur effects, as well as some subtle texture throughout to prevent it from feeling nearly as flat.

                    <p><b>Objective:</b> Create a can, in the form of a 3D cylinder, with symbol artwork of an animal food label mapped to the surface.</p>
                    <p><b>Software:</b> Adobe Illustrator</p>
                    <p>
                        To be honest, capybaras are simply majestic creatures, so I venture to say that there's no better animal to put on the can.
                        They eat mostly grass, so while it's a bit strange that this can would contain grass, at least it's accurate to their real-life diet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shape of the can itself was first laid out as guides, then a 3D cylinder was placed on top. The lid shading and the label were designed separately,
                        then applied to the cylinder as symbols.

                    <p><b>Objective:</b> Design a wrapper for an imaginary candy bar as a team of two, including company name, product details and a color scheme.</p>

                        This project was done around the time of Thanksgiving, so my teammate and I opted for a chocolate-pumpkin-pie bar, although they aren't a common combination.
                        The small details on the wrapper were made to be reasonable, excluding some jokes.

                    <p>
                        A wrapper template was given to us, which is what the structure follows (though the intended folds aren't visible here). Most of the artwork is flat vector graphics and text.
                        An accompanying presentation was created to market our product to the class.

                    <p>
                        For this, I decided to stick to simply a velociraptor rather than incorporating human elements into the design.
                        The feathers are inspired by the fact that velociraptors most likely had them in real life, and I used them to make a more distinct style for the character.
                        Also included is a backpack and a claw mark design, showing the connection to students at LASA.

                        The line art was created using primarily the pen tool, and colors were chosen according to (roughly) the school colors.
