                    <p>
                        I love to design and create, and that often takes the form of graphic design, photography, programming, and more.
                        I also especially like where these disciplines meet, such as the graphic design that goes into computer programs (namely, UX/UI design.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I was little, I've had a love for drawing, but at the same time, I was always taking things apart (or wanting to) to see how they worked,
                        and experimenting with them. And once I was introduced into the world of programming, I found it fascinating that I could command the computer
                        to do whatever I wanted, and it would do it. In a way, that's why I also came to love graphic design; I could create intricate, exact designs,
                        and the computer would take care of the rest. That's always been amazing to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For graphic design specifically, I often like to make vector art; that way, I don't have to worry about scaling issues and resolution quite as much,
                        and it's an extra challenge to create a visual style and make something look good with limited ability to create detailed effects.
                    </p>
